For people in China,they cannot connect with the Battle net server due to the conmercial dealing has annoucing failed.
However, there are many ways for poeple to connect with the other servers It's very easy on Windows but for Mac, it would tale a lot of time for poeple who have not much computer experience to learn in order to use Shell language. For myself,I would like to write an easy program which help people to play game in China.
Only open the main/ and copy the language to your teminal.Then put Enter. You can enjoy your new journey.
